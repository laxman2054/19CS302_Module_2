## AIM:
To write a C Program to print the string "KEYBOARD" n number of times.

## Algorithm
1. Start. 
2. Declare the variables i,n. 
3. Prompt the user to enter a value. 
4. Read the value using scanf. 
5. Run the for loop for “i” variable. 
6. Print “KEYBOARD\n”. 
7. End.

## Program:
```
#include<stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
int i,n; 
scanf("%d",&n); 
for(i=1;i<=n;i++) 
{printf("KEYBOARD\n"); 
}return 0; 
} 
```
